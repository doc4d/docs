title: Tables
---

Tables are the foundation of every 4D database. Each table defines a collection of records that share the same set of fields and properties.  
In the Structure editor, tables are represented as graphic objects that you can create, rename, or delete, and whose attributes you can configure individually. 

Using the tools provided by 4D, you can: 
- Define tables and manage their primary keys and relations 
- Set and edit table-level properties such as triggers, visibility, and replication 
- Control naming rules and organize tables into folders for easier maintenance 

-------- 
Creating and modifying tables

You can create tables at any time. 4D names the first table `Table_1` and then numbers them sequentially.  
You can rename or delete tables, and you can remove tables from editors by making them **invisible**.  
Table-level triggers and attributes are set in [Table properties](table-properties.md).


## Creating a table  

You can create a new table either directly in the Structure window, or via a dialog box. Direct creation is faster; but creation using the dialog box lets you specify certain parameters of the table and cancel the operation when necessary. You can also create tables using copy-paste.  

To create a new table directly:  

1. Right-click an empty area of the Structure editor window, then choose **Add Table...** from the context menu.  
**OR**  
In the add objects menu of the Structure editor tool bar, choose the Table option:  

[picture here]

4D creates the table directly in the Structure editor. You can then change its name, add fields, etc.  

:::note 

If you want to put the table in a specific folder, you need to use the Home Page of the Explorer.  

:::

To create a new table using the “New table” dialog box:  

1. Choose **New > Table...** in the File menu (or click on the New button of the 4D tool bar).  
**OR**  
On the Tables Page of the Explorer, click on the add button.  
The “New table” dialog box appears:  

[picture here]

2. (optional) Modify the name of the table you want to create.  
3. For more information about naming rules, refer to [Rules for naming tables and fields](naming-rules.md).  
4. (optional) Specify the folder in which you want to place the new table.  
By default, the table is placed at the highest level of the folder hierarchy (“Top Level”). For more information about object folders, refer to the Home Page.  
5. Click **OK**.  
If you want to cancel the operation, click the **Cancel** button.  
4D creates a new table image. It becomes the selected table image in the Structure editor window.  

:::note

Starting with 4D v14, any new table created in the database contains a primary key field by default. For more information about this, refer to [Default primary key field](primary-key-manager.md).  

:::

To create a new table by copy-paste:  

1. Select the table(s) to be duplicated and choose the standard “copy” command (4D Edit menu, context menu or using the Ctrl+C/Command+C shortcut).  
2. Then choose the Paste command either in the Edit menu, in the context menu or using the Ctrl+V/Command+V shortcut.  
The table is pasted with all its fields. It is renamed by default “Copy(X)_of_TableName,” where TableName is the original name of the table and X is the number of copies of the table.  

## Renaming a table  

You can rename tables at any time. If you have used the old table name in a method, 4th Dimension automatically changes it to the new name provided the method is closed. If the method is open, you must make the changes yourself. Each table name must be unique in the database.  

You can rename a table directly in the Structure editor, in the Explorer, or using the Inspector palette.  

To rename a table directly (Structure editor or Tables page of the Explorer):  

1. Click twice on the table name (if the table is already selected, click once).  
It switches to editing mode:  

[picture here]

2. Enter the new name and click outside of the table.  

To rename a table using the Inspector palette of the Structure editor:  

1. Double-click on the table name.  
**OR**  
Right-click on the table image, then select **Table Properties...** in the context menu.  
**OR**  
In the Explorer, double-click on the table name on the Tables page.  
4D displays the name and properties of the selected table in the Inspector palette. This palette also indicates the table number. If the Inspector palette is already open but is displaying the properties of another table or another object, just select the desired table image and the palette will then display its properties.  
2. Enter the new name in the “Name” area.  
The new name is applied immediately.  

:::note 

To find out the rules for naming tables, refer to [Rules for naming tables and fields](naming-rules.md).  
:::

## Deleting a table  

You can delete tables from your database.  
This operation can be carried out via the SQL engine of 4D or via the Structure editor.  
For more information about using SQL statements in 4D, refer to the 4D SQL Reference manual (SET MENU ITEM). 

There are two ways of deleting tables in 4D: permanent deletion (the table and its data are actually removed from the database) and non-permanent deletion (the table is simply put into the Trash (see Trash Page) and may be recovered subsequently).  

### Permanent deletion  

To permanently delete one or more database tables from the Structure editor:  

1. Select the table(s) to be deleted then choose **Clear** from the 4D Edit menu.  
**OR**  
Choose **Delete** from the context menu of the table.  
A warning dialog box will ask you to confirm the operation:  

[picture here]

If you click OK, 4D will carry out the following operations:  

- The table is permanently deleted from the structure. All the data associated with the table are deleted permanently from the data file.  
- Any trigger method associated with the table is deleted.  
- The forms and lists associated with the table are transformed into project forms and are placed in the Trash of the Explorer (see Trash Page).  

### Non-permanent deletion  

Non-permanent deletion of a table consists in putting it in the Trash of the database (which can be accessed via the Explorer), just like the file deletion mechanisms implemented by Windows and Mac OS.  

The table then no longer appears in the 4D editors and its contents become inaccessible but it can still be recovered so long as the Trash is not emptied.  

To put one or more tables into the Trash from the Structure editor:  

1. Choose the **Move to Trash** command from the context menu of the table.  
The table is immediately put into the Trash.  
**OR**  
Select the table(s) to be deleted then press the **Delete** or **Backspace** key.  
In both cases, a confirmation dialog box appears.  
2. If you click OK, the table is put into the Trash. It can be recovered at any time from the Trash Page.  

### Numbers of deleted tables  

When a table is deleted, the other tables of the database are not renumbered, so as to avoid endangering the stability of the database. It is therefore possible, for example, to have a database with three tables numbered 2, 4 and 5.  

Note that the numbers of permanently deleted tables are reused when new tables are created subsequently.  

## Table properties

You can set several properties for tables using the **Inspector palette** or, for certain properties, using the context menu for the tables.

### Triggers

A trigger is a method that runs automatically when certain events related to the table occur. The events are:

- On saving new record  
- On saving an existing record  
- On deleting a record  

Trigger events can be set in the **Inspector palette** or using the context menu associated with the table (right-click on the title area of the table):

[picture here]

Check each event for which you want to activate the trigger.  

You can access the trigger of a table directly from the Structure editor by clicking on the **Edit...** button in the Inspector palette or by selecting **Edit Method...** in the context submenu.  

> **Notes:**  
> - You can also create and display triggers with the **Methods Page** of the Explorer.  
> - The information bar of the **Structure editor** indicates the triggers that are activated for each table.  

The trigger that you enter in the Method editor will only be executed when the selected event(s) are detected.


### Attributes

You can set different attributes to configure the appearance and general behavior of each table.

#### Invisible

This option lets you make a table invisible in the Application mode and for plug-ins. You can activate this option for utility tables or tables that are not being used temporarily.

Making a table invisible allows you to limit the operations that a user can perform on a table by making the table and its fields invisible in all editors and some dialog boxes that appear in the Application environment. It can also not be used by plug-ins.  

The editors and dialog boxes concerned in the Application environment include the following:

- All query editors (see *Searching records*)  
- *Order by editor*  
- *Label editor*  
- Quick report editor (see *Managing quick reports*)  
- *Exporting and importing data* dialog boxes  
- *Formula editor*  

In each of these editors, the user is unable to see or choose the table or any of its fields. For instance, the user cannot include any fields from an invisible table in a report or label.

> **Note:** When using these editors, users have the option of saving their specifications (e.g., the query or sort they created) to disk files. In this case, any specified tables or fields that are subsequently made invisible may still be used in the operation.  
> In addition, users can type the names of invisible tables and fields in the dialog box.  

Invisible tables and fields are displayed in *italics* in the Structure editor window.


#### Color of the table image

A color can be attributed to each table. Using colors helps to organize the structure of a large database. For example, you could use one color for all tables that relate to customers and another for tables that relate to inventory.

[picture here]

> **Note:** It is also possible to attribute a color to each field individually (see *Field properties*) as well as to each relation (see *Definition*).  

To set the color of one or more tables, make your selection and then choose the color using:

- The **Color** button of the Structure editor toolbar  
- The **Color** command in the context menu of the tables  
- The **Color** option in the **Inspector palette**

The **Automatic** option can be used to apply the standard original color to the table.

---

#### Records definitively deleted

This option lets you optimize the deletion of a selection of records made using the **DELETE SELECTION** command.

When 4D deletes a selection, the record markers are also deleted. A record marker is a header attached to the record that contains information relating to this record. Deleting both markers and records is slower than deleting only records.  

In certain cases, it may be desirable to not automatically delete the record markers.

This option lets you set the type of deletion desired. To accelerate the deletion of a large selection made using the **DELETE SELECTION** command, deselect the **Records definitively deleted** option. Record markers will then not be deleted. This option cannot be set by programming.

---

#### Enable replication

When this option is checked, 4D generates the information necessary for replicating the records of the table (based more particularly on the primary key of the table).  
The record replication function allows data to be synchronized between two or more 4D databases for better security.  

Once the option is activated, the replication mechanisms must be implemented using specific SQL language commands in 4D or using the HTTP protocol.  

> For more information about this option and about the SQL replication mechanism itself, refer to *Replication via SQL*.  
> For more information about replication using HTTP, refer to *Open datastore*.  

By default, this option is not checked. For this option to be available, you must specify a primary key for the table to be replicated. Otherwise, the option is dimmed. 4D lets you set a primary key for a table directly in the Structure editor (see below).



#### Expose as REST resource

This option controls whether the table is exposed in the context requests sent to the 4D database via REST.  
By default, all tables are exposed in REST.  

For security reasons, you may want to only expose certain tables of your database. For instance, if you created a `[Users]` table storing user names and passwords, it would be better not to expose it.

If you do not want to expose a table (nor any of the fields it contains), uncheck the **Expose as REST resource** option for the table.

> **Note:** You can also set this option at the level of each field of the table (see *Field properties*).  
> This option is used in the context of ORDA remote datastore features. For more information, refer to the **Open datastore** command.


#### Include in Log File

By default, this option is checked for all new tables created and for all tables in converted databases.

Check this option in order for operations performed on the table’s data to be included in the database log file (when it is generated).  
This option must generally be checked for most tables.  
However, for optimization purposes, you can uncheck it, for example for temporary tables or tables used for importing data.

> **Note:** This option is grayed out when the table does not have a primary key.  

It is important to note that this option only indicates that the table’s data must be journaled if the database uses a log file; it does not enable the journaling procedure itself at the database level.

##### Warning messages

4D displays a warning icon to the right of the **Include in Log File** option when the required conditions are not met.

[picture here]

As long as this icon is shown, journaling is not yet enabled. You can place your mouse over this icon to find out the cause for the warning:

[picture here]

| Message | Cause | Correction needed |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| Waiting to create a primary key | Impossible to journal operations if the table does not have a primary key | Create a primary key in the table using SQL or the context menu of the table |
| Waiting for primary key values to be fixed | Primary key values have been verified and include anomalies | Remove any duplicate or null values in the records for the field (or use another primary key) |
| Waiting to enable journaling at the database level | The global option for enabling journaling is not checked | Check the *Use Log File* option on the Backup/Configuration page of the Database Settings |


#### Encryptable

This option controls whether the data stored in the table must be encrypted on disk when data file encryption is enabled (see *Encrypting data*).  

Since encrypting/decrypting can be time consuming, selecting the tables to encrypt allows you to optimize the performance of encrypted databases.  
For example, you could set only the tables that contain personal data as **Encryptable**.

Check each table whose data you want to be encrypted / decrypted.  
Note that this option flags table(s); it does not perform any encryption or decryption operation.  
To actually encrypt or decrypt selected table(s) in the data file, you must use the **MSC** (see *Encrypt page*) or call the **Encrypt data file** command.

**Important:**

- When you modify the value of this option for a table in an already encrypted database, you must also use the MSC or call the **Encrypt data file** command to preserve data consistency. Otherwise, you will not be allowed to save data in the modified table (errors will be returned by 4D when trying to save records).  
- Encryption of data stored outside of the data file (see *External data storage*) is not managed by this option.

### Comments

The **Comments** area of the **Inspector palette** lets you store additional information about the table. These comments are available for all the developers.  
Note that each field and each relation has its own comments area.

### SQL

The SQL area of the **Inspector palette** includes the “Schemas” menu and an information area.

- The “Schemas” menu lists all the SQL schemas specified in the database. You can use this menu to set the schema to which the table will belong (it is also possible to modify this property via SQL commands). Every database has at least one schema, named **DEFAULT_SCHEMA**. By default, all the tables belong to this schema. For more information about SQL schemas, refer to *Schemas in the 4D SQL Reference guide*.  
- The information area indicates whether the name of the table respects the rules regarding SQL nomenclature (for example, unlike 4D, SQL does not allow a field name to contain spaces).

### Primary keys

A primary key designates the field(s) used for uniquely identifying the records in a table. Setting a primary key is necessary for the record replication function in a 4D table (see *Replication via SQL*) as well as for the journaling function (see *Managing the log file*).  

You create, edit and/or remove primary keys directly using the context menu of the Structure editor.

> **Note:** Primary keys can also be set using the SQL language by means of the **PRIMARY KEY** clause followed by the list of columns (see *Primary key in the 4D SQL Reference Guide*).

#### Rules for using primary key fields

Primary key fields should be handled with care to ensure data integrity at all times. In particular, a primary key field must respect the following rules:

- it must not be empty,  
- it must be unique,  
- once created, it should (in principle) never be modified, especially if:
  - 4D replication or synchronization features are enabled,  
  - REST (or similar) feature is enabled,  
  - the database is periodically synchronized (backup or logical mirror using the log file).

Modifying primary key field value is highly discouraged, even if 4D allows it for specific use cases.  
If you absolutely need to modify a primary key value (e.g. you used a social security number field as primary key and incorrect values have been entered), it is preferable to disable (remove) the current primary key and to add a new field used as primary key with automatic assignment.

Primary key fields can be long integer type or UUID format (alpha type).  
In most cases, we recommend the UUID format with the Auto UUID option enabled.  
Even though the long integer type takes up less disk space, UUIDs have many advantages, for example, facilitating the merge of independent databases, data import/export, implementation of elaborate mirror/replication strategies or synchronization with external systems.

#### Setting primary keys

To create a primary key from the Structure editor:

1. Select the field(s) that make up the table’s primary key.  
2. Right-click and choose **Create primary key** in the context menu (this command is only displayed for fields whose type is eligible for primary keys):  

[picture here]

You cannot have more than one primary key for each table.  
If a primary key is already specified, a warning dialog box appears indicating that the existing primary key will first be disabled.

The primary key is created immediately. Fields included in the primary key are *underlined* in the editor and their SQL description displays the **PRIMARY KEY** keyword.

When you create a primary key in a table that already contains records (using an existing field or adding a new one), 4D checks the conformity of all the values present or automatically performs updating operations:

- The field(s) belonging to the primary key cannot contain any duplicated values. If any duplicated values for the key exist in the table records, a warning dialog box appears to indicate that it is not possible to create the key because of this.  
- If the duplicated values are blank or null values (case of an added key field), you can check the corresponding automatic generation option (for Alpha fields in or for Longint fields).  
In this case, 4D examines all the records of the table and automatically assigns a calculated value to each primary key. Note that this process is sequential and may require a significant amount of time if there are a sizable number of records.

> **Note:** The column(s) belonging to the primary key do not accept NULL values.

#### Removing primary keys

To remove a primary key from a table:

1. Right-click on the table containing the primary key and choose **Remove primary key** in the context menu:  

[picture here]

A confirmation dialog box appears. Click **OK** to remove the primary key.

#### Default primary key field

Starting with 4D v14, every new table created in the database contains a primary key by default:  

[picture here]

This field, named **"ID"** by default, is of the Longint type, and has, in particular, the following attributes:

- Unique,  
- Reject NULL value input,  
- Autoincrement,  
- Automatic index.  

> **Note:** On the **WEB SEND FILE** of the Preferences for the 4D application, you can modify the name and type of the primary keys that are created by default.  
> You can use this field as is, or change its name and/or its properties if you want (for example, you may want to use an UUID field). You can also delete it if you want to use another field (or fields) as primary key(s).  

However, it is strongly recommended to keep at least one primary key in each 4D table.  

> **Note:** Default primary keys are not added to tables that are created using the SQL **CREATE TABLE** command, or tables that are imported into the database.

## Primary key manager

The **Primary key manager** is an assistant intended to facilitate the resolution of errors related to the presence of tables without primary keys, particularly in the context of a journaled database:

[picture here]

You can use this assistant to:

- diagnose the compatibility of each database table with the 4D journaling mechanism,  
- propose a correction for each table found that is not compatible, more particularly by creating a primary key.

> **Note:** The Primary Key Manager is also available as a v13 component that you can use to prepare 4D v13 databases for conversion to v14.

### Accessing assistant

There are two ways to display the **Primary key manager** window:

- From the **Primary key error window**: click on the **Run assistant** button to display the assistant window.  
  > **Note:** The Primary key manager is displayed in Design mode. If the database starts in Application mode, the assistant does not appear right away and you will need to switch to Design mode.
  
- From the **Structure editor**: click on the button in the toolbar of this window to display the assistant.

[picture here]

### Using the assistant

The **Primary key manager** window displays a line for every table in the database:

[picture here]

> **Note:** The assistant does not take tables placed in the Trash into account.

The icon at the head of each line indicates whether the table requires the attention of the user:

| Icon | Status | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| [picture here] | OK | A valid primary key is set for the table. |
| [picture here] | No primary key, eligible field(s) | The table does not have a primary key but contains at least one field that could become the primary key. |
| [picture here] | No primary key, no eligible fields | The table does not have a primary key and does not have any fields that could become one (you will have to create a primary key field). |
| [picture here] | Warning | The table does not have a primary key but it is not journaled ("Include in Log File" option disabled for the table). It is possible to hide tables that have this status by unchecking the option to display warnings. |

For each journaled table that does not have a primary key, the assistant displays a menu to set the action to be performed. You can choose from the following options:

[picture here]

- **Ignore:** does not modify the table. The errors are not corrected and the status of the table is not changed. Use this option if you wish to intervene later, or if you want to create the primary key outside of the assistant.  
  This option is necessary in particular when you want to create a primary key based on several fields in the table.

- **Use existing field** (only shown for tables with at least one field eligible to be a primary key): designates one of the table fields as the primary key. When you choose this option, the assistant suggests the most appropriate field by default.  
  If you want to use another field or if the assistant fails to identify a particularly suitable field (the assistant displays *Select a field*), click on the second menu in the row to display the list of eligible fields.

- **Create a new field:** creates a new primary key field in the table. This field will have the same characteristics as the one added by default when a new table is created (see *Default primary key field*).  
  By default, the assistant proposes to create a field of the Longint type, named “ID”. You can modify the name and type of default primary key fields using the **WEB SEND FILE** in the Preferences of the 4D application.  
  You can access this page of the Preferences by clicking on the button in the Primary key manager window.  
  You can also change the name and/or type of the field directly in the Primary key manager window.

- **Do not log this table:** unchecks the *Include in Log File* option for the table. You can choose this option in the case of temporary tables (see *Include in Log File*). After you validate this dialog box, a “Warning” status is assigned to the table.

Once you have made your settings, click on **Apply...** to apply the changes to the database or **Close** to close the dialog box without modifying the database.  
When you click on **Apply...**, a confirmation dialog box appears listing the operations to be performed; you can either confirm or cancel the operation.

[picture here]

If you have designated existing fields as primary keys, 4D checks each table to make sure that its existing data respects the rules concerning uniqueness and null values for this type of field.  
If, for example, a field contains duplicate values or null values, an error is generated:

[picture here]

You will need to find and remove these anomalies before you can enable journaling for the data.

> **Note:** In order to facilitate the correction of errors related to primary keys, the primary key values are displayed in the **Activity analysis** page of the Maintenance and Security Center.
